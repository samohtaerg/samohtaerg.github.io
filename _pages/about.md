Hello, I’m Aoran Chen; my friends call me Thomas.  

I got my Bachelor’s degree in Mathematics from the University of Minnesota Twin Cities, where I was advised by Prof. Max Engelstein. I then earned my Master’s degree in Biostatistics at NYU GPH, advised by Prof. Yang Feng.  

I’m currently a research assistant at NYU GPH Feng Lab, working on topics in Machine Learning and High-Dimensional Statistics, and part of the SCALE Lab at Northwestern IEMS (previously NYU Courant). I like thinking about math/stats/ML, and generally anything else that interests me. Lately, I've become a fan of Warhammer 40k and am reading Horus Rising by Dan Abnett. 

Oh, and I have ADD—keeps things interesting.  


Interests
======
I am primarily interested in machine learning problems that can benefit from mathematical and statistical tools. I like exploring the geometric structure of machine learning problems and how it shapes algorithms and theory.

Inspired by John Tukey’s remark:

> *“An approximate answer to the right problem is worth a good deal more than an exact answer to an approximate problem.”*

I focus on practical problems. My goal is to develop theories that not only provide insights and rigor but are also applicable to large-scale, real-world datasets.

**Keywords**: Machine Learning, Statistical Learning Theory, Deep Learning Theory, Nonparametric Methods, High-Dimensional Statistics, Image Processing (Medical Images), Biomedical Data

Some more about me
======
I sometimes blog about topics that catch my interest, such as mathematical physics—the least action principle, quantum mechanics and path integrals, and variational approaches. I have also written about mathematical concepts like Riemannian geometry and how tropical geometry connects to neural network architectures like ReLU. Recently, I’ve been trying to reproduce GPT-2 from scratch, following Andrej Karpathy’s YouTube Video.

I spent a lot of time playing piano when I was younger. Now I make music across genres in my free time, from fugues and waltz to dark synth and melodic dubstep. I also love playing/modding games like Skyrim, Cyberpunk 2077, Monster Hunter, Overwatch, etc. 

In mathematics and physics, I used to worked on and am still drawn to geometric analysis, variational principles, and minimal surfaces—where geometric structure appear as the natural shape of least energy. I also enjoy reading entry level notes on the Langlands program, as they show a profound unity—the symmetries of numbers (Galois representations) and the symmetries of functions (automorphic representations) are actually two projections of the same underlying truth viewed from different mathematical worlds.
